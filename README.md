If anyone can figure out how to upload or "push" full files and folders please tell me (Collin). Also, I made an epic favicon, but I cant push it up onto here cause it's coded in Binary and I have no way of copy-pasting its code onto here.


Edit: I found out how to push stuff. Download the GitHub app (different from the website), and it makes a folder that you can drag files into on your computer, and from there you can sync your changes to everyone, which is essentially uploading your stuff.
